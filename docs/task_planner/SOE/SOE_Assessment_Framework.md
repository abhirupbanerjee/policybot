# SOE Assessment Framework

## Overview

State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are government-owned or controlled entities that operate in commercial or quasi-commercial activities. This framework provides a structured approach to assessing SOE health, identifying risks, and recommending policy pathways.

## Assessment Scope

### Country-Level Assessment
Evaluates all significant SOEs within a country to:
- Identify fiscally material SOEs (top 20% by impact)
- Assess systemic risks across the SOE portfolio
- Prioritize reform interventions
- Inform fiscal policy decisions

### Individual SOE Assessment
Deep-dive analysis of a specific SOE covering:
- Financial sustainability
- Operational efficiency
- Governance quality
- Strategic alignment with public policy objectives

## 7 Red Flags

Automatic triggers for elevated concern. Each red flag deducts 10 points from the Health Index.

| # | Red Flag | Triggered By Dimension | Threshold | Penalty |
|---|----------|------------------------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Consecutive operating losses | Financial Health | 3+ years | -10 |
| 2 | Negative equity | Financial Health | Any occurrence | -10 |
| 3 | Government bailout history | Risk Exposure | Within 5 years | -10 |
| 4 | Qualified audit opinion | Governance | Current or prior year | -10 |
| 5 | Board vacancies | Governance | >50% of positions | -10 |
| 6 | Excessive leverage | Financial Health | D/E ratio >3:1 | -10 |
| 7 | Revenue decline | Financial Health / Operational | 5+ consecutive years | -10 |

---

## Health Index Calculation

### Formula

```
Step 1: Calculate dimension average
  Dimension Average = (D1 + D2 + D3 + D4 + D5 + D6) / 6

Step 2: Count red flags triggered
  Red Flag Count = Number of flags where threshold is met

Step 3: Calculate Health Index
  Health Index = Dimension Average - (Red Flag Count x 10)

Step 4: Floor at 0
  Health Index = MAX(0, Health Index)
```

### Example Calculation

```
Dimensions:
  Financial:    35  -> Triggers: #1 (losses), #6 (leverage)
  Operational:  55
  Governance:   30  -> Triggers: #4 (audit), #5 (board)
  Staffing:     45
  Strategic:    60
  Risk:         25  -> Triggers: #3 (bailout)

Dimension Average = (35+55+30+45+60+25) / 6 = 41.7
Red Flags = 5
Penalty = 5 x 10 = 50

Health Index = 41.7 - 50 = -8.3 -> 0 (floored)
Pathway = Divest/Liquidate
```

## Policy Pathways

Based on Health Index score:

| Score Range | Pathway | Description | Typical Actions |
|-------------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| 70-100 | **Maintain** | Minor improvements needed | Strengthen governance, optimize operations |
| 40-69 | **Reform** | Structural changes required | Performance contracts, board renewal, cost reduction |
| 20-39 | **Restructure** | Major intervention needed | Debt restructuring, operational overhaul, merger |
| 0-19 | **Divest/Liquidate** | Not viable as SOE | Privatization, liquidation, or orderly wind-down |

### Pathway Decision Factors

Beyond the Health Index, consider:

| Factor | Questions |
|--------|-----------|
| **Political feasibility** | Union strength? Public sentiment? Electoral timing? |
| **Social impact** | Essential services? Employment in vulnerable areas? |
| **Fiscal cost** | Cost of restructuring vs. ongoing subsidies? |
| **Market conditions** | Privatization appetite? Buyer availability? |
| **Strategic importance** | National security? Natural monopoly? |

## Pareto Principle Application

For country-level assessments, apply the 80/20 rule:

1. **Rank all SOEs** by fiscal impact (subsidies + losses + guarantees)
2. **Identify top 20%** that account for ~80% of fiscal exposure
3. **Prioritize these** for detailed assessment
4. **Confirm selection** with stakeholders before deep-dive

This ensures efficient resource allocation while capturing material risks.

## Assessment Quality Guidelines

### Data Confidence Levels

When data is incomplete, indicate confidence:

| Level | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **High** | Official audited data, <2 years old | Use directly |
| **Medium** | Unaudited data, or 2-4 years old | Note limitation |
| **Low** | Estimated, proxy data, or >4 years old | Flag uncertainty |
| **None** | No data available | Mark as "Data Gap" |

### Handling Data Gaps

1. **Document the gap** explicitly in the assessment
2. **Use proxies** where reasonable (peer benchmarks, historical trends)
3. **Widen score ranges** to reflect uncertainty
4. **Recommend data collection** as an action item
5. **Assumptions** clearly specify assumptions or areas where you do not have sufficient data
