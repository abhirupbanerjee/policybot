## 3. Chat Interface

### Sending Messages

1. Type your question in the message box at the bottom
2. Press **Enter** or click the **Send** button
3. Wait for the AI to respond

### Streaming Responses

Policy Bot uses streaming responses, which means:

- A typing indicator shows the AI is working
- Responses appear word by word for faster feedback

### Understanding Responses

AI responses include:
- **Answer** - The main response to your question
- **Sources** - Document citations with page numbers
- **Relevance Scores** - How confident the AI is in each source

### Example Conversation

**You:** What are the working hours?

**Bot:** According to the Employee Handbook (page 15), standard working hours are 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday. Flexible working arrangements may be available upon manager approval.

**Sources:**
- [Employee_Handbook.pdf] Page 15 (Score: 0.89)
- [HR_Policies_2024.pdf] Page 8 (Score: 0.72)

### Message History

- Scroll up to see previous messages
- The AI remembers context from earlier in the conversation
- Very long conversations are automatically summarized to maintain context

---

## 4. Threads & Conversations

### What is a Thread?

A thread is a separate conversation with the AI. Each thread:
- Has its own message history
- Is linked to specific categories
- Can have uploaded documents

### Creating a New Thread

1. Click **+ New Thread** in the sidebar
2. Select the categories you want to query
3. Optionally name your thread
4. Click **Create**

### Selecting Categories

When creating a thread, you can select one or more categories:
- **Single category** - Query documents from one department
- **Multiple categories** - Query across multiple departments

The chat header shows which categories are active.

### Managing Threads

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Switch thread** | Click on a thread in the sidebar |
| **Rename** | Click the pencil icon or right-click |
| **Delete** | Click the trash icon or right-click |
| **Pin** | Right-click and select Pin |

### Thread Privacy

Your threads are private to you. Other users cannot see your conversations or uploaded documents.

## 5. Working with Documents

### Uploading Documents to Threads

You can upload documents to your conversation for analysis:

1. Click the **Attachment** (📎) button
2. Select your file
3. Wait for upload and processing
4. Ask questions about the document

### Upload Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Files per thread | 3 |
| Max file size | 5MB each |
| Supported types | PDF only |

### Document Compliance Checking

A common use case is checking your documents against policies:

**You:** [Uploads: expense_report.pdf]

**You:** Does this expense report comply with our travel policy?

**Bot:** I've reviewed your expense report against the Travel & Expense Policy. Here are my findings:

✅ Hotel rate is within daily limit
⚠️ Meal receipt from May 3rd is missing
❌ Transportation expense exceeds $50 limit without approval

### Tips for Document Uploads

- Upload PDFs for best results
- Keep file names descriptive
- Upload before asking questions about the content
- Documents are only available in the current thread

### Image Analysis

If your organization uses a vision-capable model (GPT-4.1, Gemini, or Mistral Large), you can upload images for analysis:

1. Click the **Attachment** (📎) button
2. Select an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP, GIF)
3. Ask questions about the image content

**Example uses:**
- "What does this flowchart show?"
- "Analyze this expense receipt"
- "Extract the data from this table image"
- "Does this diagram match our process documentation?"

**Note:** Image analysis requires a vision-capable model to be configured by your admin.

## 12. Tips & Best Practices

### Asking Better Questions

**Do:**
- Be specific: "What is the maximum number of sick days per year?"
- Provide context: "For the procurement process, what approval is needed for purchases over $5000?"
- Reference documents: "According to the Employee Handbook, what are the dress code requirements?"

**Don't:**
- Ask vague questions: "Tell me about policies"
- Ask multiple unrelated questions at once
- Assume the AI knows about recent changes not in documents

### Getting Better Answers

1. **Start with broad questions** - Then drill down into specifics
2. **Use follow-up questions** - "Can you elaborate on that?"
3. **Ask for sources** - "Which document covers this?"
4. **Request formatting** - "List the steps" or "Create a table"

### When Web Search is Used

The AI automatically searches the web when:
- Information isn't in the documents
- You ask about current events
- You specifically request web information

You'll see `[WEB]` tags on web-sourced information.

### Understanding Limitations

The AI:
- Only knows what's in the documents
- Cannot access documents you're not subscribed to
- May not have the very latest policy updates
- Provides guidance, not legal or financial advice
