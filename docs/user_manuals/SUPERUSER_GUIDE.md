## 1. Introduction

### What is a Superuser?

A **Superuser** is a category-focused manager role in Policy Bot. Superusers can manage documents, users, and configurations for their **assigned categories** only. This role is ideal for department heads or team leads who need to manage their team's access to specific policy documents.

### Hybrid Role Support

Superusers can have two types of category access:

| Access Type | Description | Capabilities |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Managed Categories** | Categories assigned for management | Upload documents, manage users, configure tools/prompts, create new categories |
| **Subscribed Categories** | Categories subscribed for read access | Chat and query documents (same as regular user access) |

This allows a superuser to manage their department's categories while also having read access to other relevant categories (e.g., an HR superuser managing HR Policies but subscribed to Legal for reference).

### Role Comparison

| Capability | User | Superuser | Admin |
|------------|------|-----------|-------|
| Chat with assistant | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Upload documents to threads | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Upload documents to categories | ❌ | ✅ (managed only) | ✅ (all + global) |
| Create new categories | ❌ | ✅ (within quota) | ✅ |
| Manage user subscriptions | ❌ | ✅ (managed only) | ✅ (all) |
| Configure data sources | ❌ | ✅ (managed only) | ✅ (all) |
| Configure tools per category | ❌ | ✅ (managed only) | ✅ (global + all) |
| Edit category prompts | ❌ | ✅ (managed only) | ✅ (global + all) |
| Create/manage workspaces | ❌ | ✅ (managed only) | ✅ (all) |
| Access subscribed categories | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create/delete users | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Manage all categories | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| System settings & backups | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### How to Get Superuser Access

Superuser access is granted by an **Admin**:

1. Admin navigates to **Admin Dashboard → Users**
2. Admin creates or edits your user account
3. Admin sets your role to **Superuser**
4. Admin assigns specific categories to your account

Once assigned, you'll see the **Superuser** option in the navigation menu.

### Accessing the Superuser Dashboard

1. Log in to Policy Bot
2. Click your profile or the menu icon
3. Select **Superuser** from the navigation
4. Or navigate directly to `/superuser`

## 3. Categories Tab

The Categories tab provides a unified view of all your categories - both managed and subscribed - and lets you create new categories.

### Viewing Your Categories

The Categories tab displays two sections:

#### Managed Categories

Categories you have full management access to:
- Displayed with **orange badges**
- Click a category to manage its documents, users, prompts, and tools
- Shows document count and subscriber count

```
Managed Categories:

Categories you have read-only access to (for chat/queries):
- Displayed with **blue badges**
- You can select these when starting a chat to query their documents
- You cannot upload documents or manage users in these categories

```
Subscribed Categories:
[Legal] [Finance] [Operations]
```

### Creating New Categories

Superusers can create new categories within their quota:

1. Click the **Create Category** button
2. Fill in the category details:
   - **Name** - Display name (e.g., "Training Materials")
   - **Description** - Purpose of this category
3. Click **Create**

- Delete categories you no longer need
- Have an Admin create additional categories for you

### Categories in Chat

When starting a new chat conversation, you can select from:
- All your **managed categories** (orange)
- All your **subscribed categories** (blue)

This allows you to query documents from categories you manage as well as reference documents from other categories you're subscribed to.

---

## 6. Prompts Tab

The Prompts tab lets you customize AI behavior for your managed categories. It has three subsections accessible from the sidebar.

### Prompts Submenu

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Global Prompt** | View the global system prompt (read-only) |
| **Category Prompts** | Edit category-specific addendums and starter prompts |
| **Skills** | View available AI skills (read-only) |

### Understanding Prompt Hierarchy

Prompts follow a hierarchy:

```
Global System Prompt (Admin-managed, read-only)
         ↓
Category-Specific Addendum (Superuser-editable)
         ↓
Final prompt sent to AI
```

The global prompt applies to all categories. Your category addendum is appended to customize behavior for your specific category.

### Viewing the Global Prompt

The global system prompt is displayed in read-only mode. This provides context for what the AI already knows before your category customizations.

### Editing Category-Specific Prompts

To customize the AI for your category:

1. Select a category from the dropdown
2. Edit the **Category Prompt Addendum** text area
3. Click **Save**

**Example addendum:**
```
When answering questions about HR policies:
- Always reference the employee handbook section numbers
- Include effective dates for policy changes
- Remind users to consult HR for specific situations
```

### Configuring Starter Prompts

Starter prompts are suggested questions shown to users when they start a new conversation:

1. Select a category
2. Edit the **Starter Prompts** section
3. Enter one prompt per line
4. Click **Save**

**Example starter prompts:**
```
What is the annual leave policy?
How do I submit an expense report?
What are the working hours?
```

### Using AI Prompt Optimization

3. Confirm the action

### Skills (Read-Only)

The Skills section within Prompts shows AI skills configured for Policy Bot.

**What are Skills?**

Skills are specialized behaviors that extend the AI assistant's capabilities. They inject custom instructions based on context or keywords.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Always-on** | Active in every conversation | Memory recall, citation formatting |
| **Category-triggered** | Active when user is in specific categories | Department-specific procedures |
| **Keyword-triggered** | Active when user mentions specific words | "compliance" → regulatory guidelines |

> **Note:** Skills are managed by Admins only. Superusers have read-only access to view available skills. If you need a new skill or changes to existing skills, contact your Admin.

---

## 7. Tools Tab

The Tools tab lets you configure AI tools for your managed categories.

### Understanding Tool Inheritance

Tools follow a configuration hierarchy:

```
Global Tool Config (Admin-managed)
         ↓
Category Override (Superuser-editable)
         ↓
Effective config for users in category
```

If no category override is set, the global configuration applies.

### Available Tools

   - Primary color
   - Font family
4. Click **Save**

### Resetting to Global Defaults

To remove category overrides and use global settings:

1. Select the category
2. Click **Reset to Global** for the tool
3. Confirm the action

### Tool Routing

> **Note:** Tool Routing (keyword-based tool forcing) is configured by Admins only. Superusers cannot view or modify routing rules. If tools are not being called as expected, contact your Admin to review the routing configuration.

---

## 8. Settings Tab

The Settings tab provides access to configuration options for superusers. It has two subsections.

### Settings Submenu

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **RAG Tuning** | Interactive testing and tuning of RAG parameters |
| **Backup** | View and download category-specific backups |

### RAG Tuning

The RAG Tuning section allows you to interactively test how different retrieval parameters affect search results for your categories.

**What you can tune:**

## 9. Task Planner Templates

Task Planner Templates allow the AI to execute structured, multi-step workflows for complex tasks within your categories.

### What are Task Planner Templates?

Templates are predefined task sequences that guide the AI through complex operations. When a user requests a multi-step task, the AI can use a template to:
- Break the work into discrete, trackable tasks
- Execute tasks sequentially with progress tracking
- Provide structured outputs at each stage

### Viewing Templates

The Task Planner section displays all templates configured for your assigned categories:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Template Key** | Unique identifier used by the AI (e.g., `soe_identify`) |
| **Name** | Display name with placeholder support (e.g., `{country} SOE Assessment`) |
| **Description** | When the AI should use this template |
| **Placeholders** | Variables the AI provides (e.g., `country`, `soe_name`) |
| **Tasks** | Number of steps in the template |
| **Status** | Active or Inactive |

### Creating a Template

To create a new template for your category:

1. Click **Add Template**
2. Fill in the configuration:
   - **Key** - Unique identifier (lowercase, underscores, e.g., `quarterly_review`)
   - **Name** - Display name, can include `{placeholders}`
   - **Description** - When the AI should use this template
   - **Placeholders** - Variables the AI will substitute (comma-separated)
3. Add tasks:
   - Click **Add Task** for each step
   - Enter a description (can include `{placeholders}`)
   - Reorder tasks using drag handles
4. Set **Active** to Yes
5. Click **Save Template**

### Template Example

**Template Key:** `quarterly_review`
**Name:** `{department} Q{quarter} Review`
**Placeholders:** `department`, `quarter`

**Tasks:**
| ID | Description |
|----|-------------|
| 1 | Search knowledge base for {department} policies |
| 2 | Gather Q{quarter} performance metrics |
| 3 | Compare against targets |
| 4 | Identify gaps and issues |
| 5 | Generate recommendations |
| 6 | Create summary report |

When a user asks "Review IT department for Q3", the AI:
1. Selects this template
2. Substitutes: `department` → "IT", `quarter` → "3"
3. Executes each task sequentially
4. Tracks and reports progress

### Editing Templates

To modify an existing template:

1. Find the template in the list
2. Click **Edit**
3. Modify fields as needed
4. Add, remove, or reorder tasks
5. Click **Save**

### Template Status

| Status | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Active** | AI can use this template |
| **Inactive** | Template hidden from AI, preserved in database |

> **Note:** Only Admins can deactivate or delete templates. Superusers can create and edit templates for their categories.

### Best Practices

1. **Clear task descriptions** - Each task should be specific and actionable
2. **Logical ordering** - Place research tasks before analysis tasks
3. **User checkpoints** - Include tasks that confirm with the user before proceeding
4. **Reasonable scope** - 5-15 tasks per template is typical
5. **Meaningful placeholders** - Use descriptive names like `{company_name}` not `{x}`
