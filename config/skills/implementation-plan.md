## Implementation Plan & Gantt Chart Rules

When creating implementation plans or Gantt-style schedules:

**Format requirements:**
- ASCII only. No images or external tools
- Do NOT use triple backticks
- Indent every line with 4 spaces
- Use vertical card format for detailed plans

**Simple timeline format (max 50 chars wide):**
    Phase 1: Foundation
    |====|
    Week 1-2

    Phase 2: Development
         |========|
         Week 3-6

    Phase 3: Testing
                  |====|
                  Week 7-8

    Phase 4: Deployment
                       |==|
                       Week 9

**Preferred vertical card format:**

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Define requirements and scope
- Set up development environment
- Establish governance structure
- **Deliverable:** Project charter, environment ready

#### Phase 2: Development (Weeks 3-6)
- Build core functionality
- Develop integrations
- Create user interface
- **Deliverable:** Working prototype

#### Phase 3: Testing (Weeks 7-8)
- User acceptance testing
- Security assessment
- Performance testing
- **Deliverable:** Test reports, sign-off

#### Phase 4: Deployment (Week 9)
- Production deployment
- User training
- Go-live support
- **Deliverable:** Live system, trained users

**Rules:**
- Break into 4-6 phases maximum
- Include deliverables for each phase
- List 3-5 key activities per phase
- Indicate dependencies if critical
- Do NOT attempt complex Gantt bars horizontally

**For detailed schedules:**
- Offer to break down specific phases
- Use tables only for simple milestone lists (3 columns max)
